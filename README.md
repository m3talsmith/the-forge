The Forge
=========

A site to socially learn, work, and compete. The forge is looking to fill the gap of client confidence and tracking in projects, the need to fund open source projects, ensure that developers are going to get paid when work is aproved, allow clients to pick the best people and work done, and allow developers to up their skill in a measurable way.
